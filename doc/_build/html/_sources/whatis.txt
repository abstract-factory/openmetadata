Why Open Metadata?
----------------------

There is more to say about content than the content itself. Librarians have used the concept for decades in the form of cards put within the cover of books to tell who's borrowed it and when.

Why Open?
---------

Most software provide you with the ability to augment content with additional information, yet most software go with unique and proprietary methods of doing so.

This is not very flexible as it means you, the coder, will have to parse that information - conforming it to your code - before making use of it.

Not only that, but most software provide different levels of flexibility and a restricted support for the type of data you are allowed to augment with, for instance the ratings of media files on the Windows operating system, or the fixed set of containers for mp3 files (author, date, comment and so on). 

But how can you make use of this data once it's been put there?

Open Metadata is an attempt to alleviate some of the re-inventing going on as well as unifying the read/write of this data so as to be useful outside of their target application.

Screw that
----------

You may use it to store information about content anywhere a folder can exist.

Open Metadata is type-agnostic, meaning it doesn't care about the type in which you store your data. Be it a line of text about your music collection, documentation about your code or images about production work such as shots and assets.
