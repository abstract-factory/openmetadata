   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Open Metadata's documentation!
-----------------------------------------

`Open Metadata <http://pipi.io/>`_ is a cross-platform hierarchical `metadata <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata>`_ format for storing and accessing any `format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format>`_ via any `protocol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol>`_ of unlimited size and complexity. The code is open source and is `available on GitHub <https://github.com/mottosso/OpenMetadata>`_.

You may use it to store information about content anywhere a folder can exist.

Open Metadata is type agnostic, meaning it doesn't care about the type in which you store your data. Be it a line of text about your music collection, documentation about your code or images about production work such as shots and assets.
